This program is a simple Rss reader that adds desired urls to a file in your computer system and then shows the top 5 feeds on the websites.
It processes, organizes and creates an easy access to the newest feeds on the websites you add. You can also remove any website you donâ€™t want to collect data on whenever you want. 
here is a video showing how it works on your terminal:
